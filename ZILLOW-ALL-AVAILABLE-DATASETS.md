## Priority Recommendations

For US/National and Metro level data, I recommend adding these high-priority datasets:

1. **New Listings** - Important for understanding market activity
2. **Median List Price** - Key pricing metric
3. **Mean Sale Price** - Complements median sale price
4. **Sale-to-List Ratio** - Important market indicator
5. **Percent Above/Below List** - Market competitiveness indicator
6. **Days to Close** - Complements days to pending
7. **Price Cuts** - Market condition indicator

These would provide a much more comprehensive view of the real estate market.
